Here is the lore: The world has long been a wasteland caused by an unspecified event. 
In the wake of the descrution of society pockets of new goverments began to form with three major powers controlling sections of the US specificly the 
east coast, mid-west, and the west coast. With the fall of the US goverment meant that the US dollar became worthless, thus a new economy formed one based on Ullas. 
Ullas are an animal that look like a medium sized dog that are quite mischievous but who hold mystical properties.
However, Ullas are a controversal bunch as the newly formed mid-western goverment bans the usage of Ullas.
In adition to goverment pressurs, there are also raiders in the ungoverned portion of the US (typically inbtween large cities) these raiders
hunt Ullas and would attack anyone to get their hands on some Ullas.
